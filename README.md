NUMBER GUESSING GAME

        C++ program to implement the Number Guessing Game. In this game the computer chooses a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess the number in as few attempts as possible. Each time the player enters a guess, the computer tells him whether the guess is too high, too low, or right. Once the player guesses the number, the game is over. 


task2:-

simple calculator

        This program takes an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /) and two operands from a user and performs the operation on those two operands depending upon the operator entered by the user.
        This program takes an operator and two operands from the user.The operator is stored in variable op and two numbers are stored in num1 and num2 respectively.Then, switch...case statement is used for checking the operator entered by user.If user enters + then, statements for case: '+' is executed and program is terminated. If user enters - then, statements for case: '-' is executed and program is terminated.This program works similarly for the * and / operators. But, if the operator doesn't matches any of the four character [ +, -, * and / ], the default statement is executed which displays error message.


task3:-

TIC TAC TOE GAME

       Tic Tac Toe is an integral part of our childhood memories. It is a fun game consisting of two players who battle each other using Xs and Os. But did you know that this game can be a good C++ project? If you program it correctly, you can have fun playing it on your PC with your friends again.
        This tutorial explains how to create a simple game of tic tac toe using C++ programming language. This article contains a simple source code of the Tic Tac Toe game for two players with proper documentation.


task4:-

TO-DO-LIST

      In this program, we are going to create To Do List in C++ with the help of file handling. By using file handling we can persist the data even when we close the program and re-run it, which means we will be able to view the tasks even when we restart the program.

      Features
                1.The user can add a new task
                2.Update the existing task
                3.Delete a task from the list of todo
                4.View all the tasks
                5.All the data is preserved as we use file handling
